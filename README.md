# Event Management API

The **Event Management API** is a robust backend service designed to simplify the management of events, including creation, registration, scheduling, and attendee tracking. This API is built with scalability and flexibility in mind, providing developers with endpoints to seamlessly integrate event management features into their applications.

## Features

- **Event Creation and Management**: Create, update, and delete events with detailed attributes such as name, date, location, and description.
- **Attendee Registration**: Allow users to register for events, view registration details, and manage their participation.
- **Event Scheduling**: Manage event schedules, set time zones, and avoid scheduling conflicts.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for administrators and attendees.
- **Search and Filter**: Find events based on keywords, dates, locations, or categories.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Gain insights into event performance, attendee demographics, and registration trends.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: [Your backend framework, e.g., Node.js, Flask, Django]
- **Database**: [Your database, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
- **Authentication**: [Authentication method, e.g., JWT, OAuth]
- **Hosting**: [Hosting provider, e.g., AWS, Heroku]
- **API Documentation**: [Documentation tool, e.g., Swagger, Postman]
